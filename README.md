# titan-x-pascal-pill
First gen GDDR5X card, Nvidia Titan X Pascal, cannot be improved by using an infamous ETH largement pill: https://github.com/Virosa/ETHlargementPill

Goal of this project is to bring GDDR5X improved timing support to my favourite Nvidia GPU that I sometimes use for mining to support myself as a university student. 
Supported on:
- Windows
- Linux
